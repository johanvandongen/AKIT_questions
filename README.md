# Author Questions
This tool reads data from a Google document and stores it in local storage. The user first authenticates with his/her Google account and will parse the Google document that was specified by its URL. 

This project was made, because in the company I'm in, we were filling in question forms in a Google doc. I found it hard to filter these questions on certain attributes and thought it would be cool to get all this data from the Google doc and display it in a user friendly way.
